Contact domains are closely linked to gene regulation and lineage commitment, while current understanding of contact domains and their boundaries is still limited. Here, we present a novel method HiCDB, which is constructively based on local relative insulation metric and multi-scale aggregation approach to detect contact domain boundaries (CDBs) on Hi-C maps. Compared with other ‘state-of-art’ methods, HiCDB shows improved sensitivity and speciﬁcity in determining CDBs at various Hi-C resolutions. The superiority of HiCDB enabled us to study the epigenetic features of detected CDBs and showed enrichment of architectural proteins and cell-typespeciﬁc transcription factor binding sites at CDBs. The further comparison of GM12878 and IMR90 HiC datasets suggested that cell-type-speciﬁc CDBs are marked by active regulatory signals and correlate with activation of nearby cell identity genes.
