PhD. student  
MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics  
Bioinformatics Division, TNLIST & Department of Automation  
FIT 1-108, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China  


Academic Interests
======
I have broad interests in applying statistical or machine leaning methods in genomic study. Currently, I mainly focus on   
1) developing novel statistical methods to analyze and explore the Hi-C data, as well as   
2) NGS data integration analysis centered on Hi-C data to give biological insights in development and disease.
