PhD. student
MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics Division, TNLIST & Department of Automation
FIT 1-108, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China


Academic Interests
======
I have broad interests in applying statistical or machine leaning methods in genomic study. Currently, I mainly focus on 1) developing novel statistical methods to analyze and explore the Hi-C data, as well as 2) NGS data integration analysis centered on Hi-C data to give biological insights in development and disease.

other concerns:
molecular mechanism of human recombination events
regulation in 3D micro-scaffold cultured cells
gene regulation network
